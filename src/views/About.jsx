          Node, MySQL, and Express.JS, after the bootcamp I've worked to expand my skills to include MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes. I am currently looking for a career change into Full Stack Javascript Engineering. I am a constant learner, and adament problem solver. While I definiately 
          consider myself resourceful, I also know when I am beat and am not afraid to seek out additional help.
